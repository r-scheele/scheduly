# Features

AWS EC2 Instance Scheduler is a tool that allows you to schedule the start and stop times of your EC2 instances. This allows you to save money by only running your instances when they are needed, and to automate the process of starting and stopping instances.

## Use Case

A large e-commerce company is using AWS to host their website and backend services. The website experiences spikes in traffic during peak hours, and the company wants to ensure that their EC2 instances are able to handle the increased load without incurring unnecessary costs. The company decides to implement a scheduling software that automatically starts and stops EC2 instances based on the expected traffic patterns.

The scheduling software uses a combination of AWS CloudWatch and machine learning algorithms to predict the traffic patterns and the required number of EC2 instances. During off-peak hours, the software automatically stops unused EC2 instances to reduce costs, and during peak hours, it starts additional instances to handle the increased traffic.

The scheduling software integrates with the company's DevOps workflow, and the EC2 instance schedules are managed as part of the company's infrastructure-as-code. The company is able to save money on their AWS bill, and their website is able to handle the increased traffic during peak hours, providing a better experience for their customers.

## Working parts

1. Dynamic Scheduling: A tool that automatically adjusts EC2 instance schedules based on changes in demand, such as increases in traffic or workloads.

2. Multi-Region Scheduling: A tool that allows EC2 instances to be scheduled across multiple AWS regions, allowing for automatic failover and improved availability.

3. Predictive Scheduling: A tool that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the optimal EC2 instance schedule based on past usage patterns and other data.

4. Cost-Optimized Scheduling: A tool that considers the cost of EC2 instances, including on-demand, spot, and reserved instances, and schedules instances based on the optimal balance of cost and performance.

5. DevOps Integration: A tool that integrates with popular DevOps tools, such as Ansible or Terraform, to automate EC2 instance scheduling as part of a larger infrastructure-as-code workflow.


## Implementation

1. Dynamic Scheduling:
    * Start by collecting data on the usage patterns of your EC2 instances. This could be done using AWS CloudWatch or a custom monitoring solution.
    * Analyze the data to identify the instances that can be scheduled dynamically.
    * Write a Golang script that uses the AWS SDK to start and stop EC2 instances based on the demand data. The script can be triggered by a cron job or triggered programmatically.
    Test the script to make sure it works as expected and make any necessary adjustments.
2. Multi-Region Scheduling:

    * Start by setting up your AWS infrastructure in multiple regions.
    Write a Golang script that uses the AWS SDK to start and stop EC2 instances in different regions based on your schedule.
    * Test the script to make sure it works as expected in each region and make any necessary adjustments.
3. Predictive Scheduling:

    * Start by collecting data on the usage patterns of your EC2 instances.
    Analyze the data to identify patterns and trends that can be used to predict future demand.
    * Write a Golang script that uses machine learning algorithms to make predictions based on the usage data.
    Integrate the predictions into your EC2 instance scheduling script to automatically start and stop instances based on the predictions.
    * Test the script to make sure it works as expected and make any necessary adjustments.
4. Cost-Optimized Scheduling:

    * Start by collecting data on the costs of different EC2 instance types, including on-demand, spot, and reserved instances.
    * Write a Golang script that uses the AWS SDK to start and stop EC2 instances based on the optimal balance of cost and performance.
    * Test the script to make sure it works as expected and make any necessary adjustments.
5. DevOps Integration:

    * Choose a DevOps tool that you would like to integrate with, such as Ansible or Terraform.
    * Write a Golang script that uses the AWS SDK to start and stop EC2 instances as part of a larger infrastructure-as-code workflow.
    * Integrate the script into your DevOps tool by following the tool's documentation and best practices.
    Test the integration to make sure it works as expected and make any necessary adjustments.



## Elaborate use case for features

1. Dynamic Scheduling:
    A startup company is hosting their web application on AWS. The web application experiences spikes in traffic throughout the day, but the usage patterns are unpredictable. The company wants to ensure that their EC2 instances are able to handle the increased load without incurring unnecessary costs. They implement a dynamic scheduling software that automatically starts and stops EC2 instances based on the real-time traffic patterns. The software uses AWS CloudWatch to monitor the traffic and start or stop instances as needed.

2. Multi-Region Scheduling:
    A large multinational corporation is using AWS to host their critical business applications. The corporation wants to ensure that their applications are highly available and can continue to operate in the event of a regional outage. They implement a multi-region scheduling software that automatically starts and stops EC2 instances in multiple AWS regions based on a predefined schedule. The software ensures that the instances in one region can take over if the instances in another region become unavailable.

3. Predictive Scheduling:
    A software company is hosting their SaaS application on AWS. The application experiences spikes in traffic at certain times of the day, but the spikes are not predictable. The company wants to ensure that their EC2 instances are able to handle the increased load without incurring unnecessary costs. They implement a predictive scheduling software that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the traffic patterns and the required number of EC2 instances. The software starts and stops instances based on the predictions, ensuring that the instances are available when they are needed.

4. Cost-Optimized Scheduling:
    A financial services company is hosting their web applications on AWS. The company wants to ensure that they are getting the best value for their money while still ensuring that their applications are highly available. They implement a cost-optimized scheduling software that automatically starts and stops EC2 instances based on the optimal balance of cost and performance. The software uses AWS pricing information and custom algorithms to determine the most cost-effective instance types to use at any given time.

5. DevOps Integration:
    A technology company is hosting their web applications on AWS and is using Ansible as their DevOps tool. The company wants to ensure that their EC2 instance scheduling is part of their infrastructure-as-code and is managed in a consistent and automated manner. They implement a DevOps integration for their EC2 instance scheduling software, which automatically starts and stops instances as part of their Ansible playbooks. The company is able to manage their EC2 instance schedules along with the rest of their infrastructure, ensuring that the schedules are consistent and up-to-date.
